		 I was thrilled to work with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta once again, to create this illustrated journal for young patients. Packed full of activity pages and ingenious prompts, the book is meant to give tweens spending time in the hospital a positive outlet for often complicated emotions and ideas. Inspired by travel in all forms, the journal was an illustrator's dream project largely because of the variety of illustrations and graphics, hand-lettering and infographics to explore.
